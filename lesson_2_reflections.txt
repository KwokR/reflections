1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When a I initialize a repository it creates a hidden .git folder within
	the repository. This helps to identify the directory as a git directory
	so there can be version control on it.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
	What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a place where you can add documents that you want commited into
	git. You can choose which files to commit rather than committing everything in the 
	directory.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	
	Add only files that are relavent to the logical change to the staging area

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? 
	How would branches help?

	Branches have logical labels instead of a long character set. If I have a working 
	application but would like to do some testing without breaking the working version.
