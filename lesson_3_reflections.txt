1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you want to access your files from another computer or if you want to collaborate with 
  someone.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
	stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Manual pull provides you with an extral layer of control. Perhaps there are certain changes
	you would like to make and branch off before pulling a new updated version.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	forks is similar to clone but on github. Clone will copy a repositoty from github onto
	my local machine. branches are versions of the file that have diverged from the 'production' file.
	There can be multiple branches that can run parallel to the production *master branch.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	
	The copy of the last known state if the remote helps to distinguish at what point in time did 
	I last pull a copy from remote. This mechanism allows multiple updates on the repo and having a 
	way to determine if same areas have been changed in the same file. 

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	
	I would use the google suite for collaboration or send files back and forth between my collaborator.
	It is much easier with github if you are comfortable with the github environment. For normal documents 
	it would be much easier to use the google appications
