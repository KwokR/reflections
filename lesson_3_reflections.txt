1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you want to access your files from another computer or if you want to collaborate with 
  someone.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
	stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Manual pull provides you with an extral layer of control. Perhaps there are certain changes
	you would like to make and branch off before pulling a new updated version.
